â€¢Perform http POST & DELETE request
	Previously we use axios for http GET request.
	Similarly GET,POST & DELETE http calls can perform on form submission according to requirement using axios.
	We can use any backend technology to perform async operations.
	React connect well with any backend technology.
	In this we will use json-server which is use to fake backend services.
	
	Â»Installation of Json-server
		npm install json-server.
		
	Â»JSON file
		Create a JSON file with any name with the extension (.json).
		This file consits of the data, that must be export by REST API CRUD endpoints are automatically created for objects to JSON.
		
	Â»Running the server
		Start the sever by
			json-server --watch db.json --port 4000
			
		As a parameter we need to pass the json file.
		--watch, this parameter starts the server in watch mode, means if any changes done in file that updates the exposed API.
		--port, this specifies on which port to run the server, default is 3000
		The following HTTP request are automatically created by json-server.
	
	Â»Http POST & DELETE
		we've used .post & .delete method of axios to see how data gets saved on the server & gets deleted from the server.
