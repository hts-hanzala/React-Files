•Props(Properties)

	When we want to pass any data between components from one to another it known as props.
	Props are immutable
	In class components these can be accessed as this.props.
	
	»How to use props
	
		In class based components to pass the data in any component write in App.js
		<ClassBasedComponents initial={10}/>
		Here initial is a prop with the value 10.
		TO get the value in ClassBasedComponents
			we have to write prop as an arguement
				    constructor(props){
					super(props)
				  }
		Now in the whole component we can render the value of the props wherever we want to.
		{this.props.initial}  -> This is how we can render the props value.
