•Hooks
	»Context API
		This is used to overcome the props drilling problem.
		This is just like a warehouse of data which provides to pass / share data through multiple componenets.
		For this first we need to create a context then assign Provider & Consumer.
		Context provides a way to share values like between componenets without having to explicity pass a prop to the every level of the tree.
		
	»useContext()
		This is same as context API
		this is used to pass data from one componenet to multiple componenets.
		
	»Custom Hooks
		This is used to create own hooks.
		This hooks are the pre-defined hooks (useState, useEffect ...)
		We're creating a componenet & using that hook in the created componenets & then calling only the componenet where we need it is called custom hooks.
